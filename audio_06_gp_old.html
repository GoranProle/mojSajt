				Well the dawn was coming,<br>
				heard him ringing on my bell.<br>
				He said, "My name's the teacher,<br>
				oh, that is what I call myself.<br>
				And I have a lesson<br>
				that I must impart to you.<br>
				It's an old expression<br>
				but I must insist it's true.<p>

				Jump up, look around,<br>
				find yourself some fun,<br>
				no sense in sitting there hating everyone.<br>
				No man's an island and his castle isn't home,<br>
				the nest is full of nothing when the bird has flown."<p>

				So I took a journey,<br>
				threw my world into the sea.<br>
				With me went the teacher<br>
				who found fun instead of me.<p>

				Hey man, what's the plan, what was that you said?<br>
				Sun-tanned, drink in hand, lying there in bed.<br>
				I try to socialize but I can't seem to find<br>
				what I was looking for, got something on my mind.<p>

				Then the teacher told me<br>
				it had been a lot of fun.<br>
				Thanked me for his ticket<br>
				and all that I had done.<p>

				Hey man, what's the plan, what was that you said?<br>
				Sun-tanned, drink in hand, lying there in bed.<br>
				I try to socialize but I can't seem to find<br>
				what I was looking for, got something on my mind.<p>
