				You gotta roll with it<br>
				You gotta take your time<br>
				You gotta say what you say<br>
				Don't let anybody get in your way<br>
				'Cause it's all too much for me to take<p>
				
				Don't ever stand aside<br>
				Don't ever be denied<br>
				You wanna be who you'd be<br>
				If you're coming with me<p>
				
				I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside<br>
				I think I'm gonna take me away and hide<br>
				I'm thinking of things that I just can't abide<p>
				
				I know the roads down which your life will drive<br>
				I find the key that lets you slip inside<br>
				Kiss the girl, she's not behind the door<br>
				But you know I think I recognize your face<br>
				But I've never seen you before<p>
